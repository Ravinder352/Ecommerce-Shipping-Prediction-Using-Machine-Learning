# Ecommerce Shipping Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

### Project Overview

The current state of ecommerce shipping processes is fraught with inefficiencies that result in delayed deliveries and increased costs. Accurate delivery time prediction remains a significant challenge due to various influencing factors such as weather conditions, traffic, and other external variables. This project aims to enhance ecommerce operations by leveraging machine learning to predict delivery times accurately, thereby improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
